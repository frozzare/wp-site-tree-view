# Site Tree View

Prototype of a site tree view plugin for WordPress that will try to solve the full site structure (that a visitor can visit) tree and not per post type or category (categories don't exists in the prototype yet). This prototype registers the custom post type `books` that will will not be a part of the stable plugin.

Install it by cloning the repository to the plugins (or mu-plugins) folder.

If this will become a real stable plugin someday then it will be moved to [wpup](https://github.com/wpup) organization.
